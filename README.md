# Season- and Trend-aware Symbolic Approximation for Efficient Time Series Matching (Supporting Material)
Time series matching is an important prerequisite of many data-mining tasks and yet it is a challenging problem. A time series is a high-dimensional data type whose representation is space- and whose comparison is time-consuming. Among the representation techniques that tackle these challenges the symbolic aggregation approximation is of particular interest. This technique reduces a time series in a low-dimensional space by segmenting it and discretizing each segment into a small alphabet of symbols. However, it ignores the deterministic behavior of a time series such as, e.g., its cyclical repeated season or its trend component that affects all segments and that leads to a distortion of the symbolic distribution. With this in mind, we present a season- and trend-aware symbolic approximation. They improve the symbolic distribution and the representation accuracy while keeping the same representation size. Thus, they provide a more efficient time series matching.

## Scripts
The directory *Implementation* contains the scripts to carry out the evaluation:

 - *main.R*: bundles generation, distance calculation and evaluation scripts
 - *sources* (in logical order):
	 - *generate.R*: generation of synthetic time series datasets
	 - *euclidean_distance.R*: calculation of Euclidean distance on synthetic and real-world datasets
	 - *method.R*: construction of representation technique based on configuration and dataset parameters
	 - *represent.R*: transformation of a time series dataset into representation
	 - *distance.R*: calculation of representation distance
	 - *exact_search.R*: linear search (exact matching)
	 - *approximate_search.R*: linear search (approximate matching)
	 - *eval.R*: textual and visual evaluation of results
	 - *run.R*: helper methods for evaluation scripts
	 - *util.R*: helper methods for file management and data frames
 - *configs*: configuration parameters for representation techniques and dataset parameters
 - *fonts*: font family for plotting

Required packages:

 - idxrepr (see below)
 - data.table
 - distr
 - parallel
 - R.utils
 - ggplot2
 - directlabels

## Datasets
The directory *Data* contains the datasets together with representations, intermediate and final results of the evaluation.

 - Synthetic time series datasets (*Season*, *Trend*) are generated by the scripts
 - *Metering* dataset
	 - This dataset have to be included manually from [Irish Social Science Data Archive](www.ucd.ie/issda)
	 - It is the dataset "CER Smart Metering Project" of the Commission for Energy Regulation
	 - Select the 5958 time series with 21840 values
	 - Store the dataset in Data/issda_I_5958_T_21840_L_1_48/dataset.rds
 - The *Economy* dataset is provided under Data/m4_I_6400_T_300/dataset.rds

## Representation Techniques

The *idxrepr* package contains the representation techniques: [https://github.com/dsaa2019-anonuser/idxrepr](https://github.com/dsaa2019-anonuser/idxrepr). Install this package to run the evaluation.

## Software Environment
The software has been tested under

 - Windows 10 with R 3.4.4 and Rtools 3.4.0.1964
 - Linux Ubuntu 14.04.6 LTS with R 3.4.4 and gcc 4.8.4
